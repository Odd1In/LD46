Active Earth Rush is a dark action game where you have to transport energy to the Earth to keep the simulated Earth's alive.
Enemies get in your way and they will try their best to make sure the energy doesn't reach the little planets in the secret room.

How to play (There is an in game tutorial if you need it):

- Get to the pickup zone
- Pick up the box
- Transport the box to the drop off zone
- Go back to the pick up zone
